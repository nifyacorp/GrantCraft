## Directory Structure

- **`api/`:** Holds detailed API specifications including OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications, data schemas/models for API requests/responses, and authentication/authorization documentation.

- **`design/`:** Contains UI/UX design documents, wireframes, mockups, user flow diagrams, and design system guidelines.

## Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown (`.md`) format for all documents for easy version control and readability.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with the codebase and system design.
- For diagrams, use tools like Mermaid, PlantUML, or other diagramming software and store source files alongside exported images when possible.
- Important documentation should be reviewed by the team, especially architectural decisions and API specifications.
