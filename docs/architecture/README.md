# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains high-level system architecture diagrams, component breakdowns, service interaction diagrams, and architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Contents

- **STRUCTURE.md** - Overview of the microservice structure
- **ProjectStructure.md** - GCP architecture overview
- **GCPRebuildPlan.md** - Plan for rebuilding on GCP infrastructure

## Purpose

The documentation in this directory helps:

- Provide a clear understanding of the overall system architecture
- Document key architectural decisions and their rationales
- Serve as a reference for understanding component interactions
- Guide implementation and future architectural changes

## Guidelines

- Diagrams should be kept up-to-date with the current architecture
- Major architectural changes should be documented with their reasoning
- When possible, include both source files and exported images for diagrams
