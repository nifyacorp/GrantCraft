# Data Models Documentation

This directory contains detailed data model definitions, database schemas, and related documentation for the GrantCraft system.

## Purpose

The models documentation serves to:
- Define the core data structures used throughout the system
- Document database schemas and relationships
- Provide reference for developers implementing or using these models
- Establish data integrity rules and constraints

## Contents

- **Core Models**: Definitions of primary data structures in the system
- **Database Schemas**: Documentation of database tables and relationships
- **Data Validation**: Rules and constraints for data integrity
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams**: Visual representations of data relationships

## Guidelines

- Model documentation should be kept in sync with actual implementations
- Changes to models should be documented with rationale
- Diagrams should be used to visualize complex relationships
- Versioning should be considered for significant model changes
